### Configuring the Logging Server (Receiving End)

1. **SSH into the logging server:**

   
   ssh 192.168.75.20
   ```

2. **Edit `rsyslog` configuration file:**

   
   vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
   ```

3. **Enable UDP listener for `rsyslog`:**

   Add or uncomment the following lines in `rsyslog.conf` to enable UDP listener on port 514:

   
   $ModLoad imudp.so
   $UDPServerRun 514
   ```

4. **Open firewall port for UDP 514:**

   
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/udp
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

   This command allows incoming UDP traffic on port 514, which is used by `rsyslog` for receiving log messages.

5. **Start and enable `rsyslog` service:**

   
   systemctl start rsyslog.service
   systemctl enable rsyslog.service
   ```

   Ensure that `rsyslog` is running and set to start automatically on system boot.

### Configuring the Client (Sending End)

1. **Edit `rsyslog` configuration file on the client:**

   
   vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
   ```

2. **Forward all log messages to the logging server:**

   Add the following line at the end of `rsyslog.conf` on the client to forward all log messages to the logging server (`192.168.75.20`) via UDP port 514:

   
   *.* @192.168.75.20:514
   ```

   - `*.*` indicates all facilities and priorities. Adjust this as needed based on your logging requirements.

3. **Restart `rsyslog` service on the client:**

   
   systemctl restart rsyslog.service
   ```

4. **Open firewall port for UDP 514 (if not already open):**

   
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=514/udp
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

5. **Verify the UDP port configuration:**

   
   firewall-cmd --list-ports
   ```

   Ensure that port 514/udp is listed to confirm that the firewall rule is applied correctly.

6. **Send a test log message from the client:**

   
   logger -i "This is a test log message from the client"
   ```

7. **Check the logs on the logging server:**

   SSH back into the logging server:

   
   ssh 192.168.75.20
   ```

   View the incoming log messages in `/var/log/messages` or the appropriate log file based on your `rsyslog` configuration:

   
   tail -f /var/log/messages
   ```

   This command allows you to monitor incoming log messages in real-time.

### Notes:

- **rsyslog Configuration**: Make sure you configure `rsyslog` correctly on both the client and the server to ensure proper log forwarding.
- **Firewall**: Adjust firewall rules (`firewall-cmd`) as necessary to allow UDP traffic on port 514.
- **Testing**: Use `logger` command on the client to send test log messages and verify their reception on the logging server.
